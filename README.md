# Homomorphic_filter
A basic homomorphic filter app for image enhancement and correction.
This script was developed using discrete Fourier transforms to solve uneven illumination of optical microscopy images in a scientific context.
The app includes a compression parameter "Comp" that reduces the pixel count, three parameters linked with the Fourier transform that manage the saturation, sharpness and intensity of the filter. These should be adapted for all specific cases. 
The app also contains a "safe image scale" tick-box that leaves the image scale untreated (most of the time...).

For now the script doesn't support batch processing, I might add it later.

Hope it'll be useful!

--- App availible in .exe and .py (python 3) , note that your antivirus might be scared of the .exe ---
