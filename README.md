# Homomorphic_filter
A basic homomorphic filter app for image enhancement and correction.
This script was developped using discrete fourrier transforms to solve uneven illumnation of optical microscopy images in a scientific context.
The app includes a compression parameter "Comp" that reduces the pixel count, three parameters linked with the fourrier transform that manage the saturation, sharpness and intensity of the filter. These should be adapted for all specific cases.
For now the script doesn't support batch processing, I might add it later.

Hope it helps!!
